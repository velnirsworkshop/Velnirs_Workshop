# Introduction

Hey everyone this is Velnir and my attempt at contributing to Baldur's Gate 3 Modding Community. This Mod aims to add many things as a compilation of sorts from my Dungeons and Dragons Homebrew material.
This mod will include classes, subclasses, items, and many more to all the goodies I ever created in my longtime career as a Proffesional Dungeon Master

## For Modders

This mod will support modders once its main functionality is ironed out so they can create their own armor sets or weapons. For now, feel free to DM me on Discord if you need any modding help. There will be a Wiki Set Up to Provide Templates on how to implement your ideas.

## For Players

I hope you can enjoy this mod as much as I do testing and playing it. All this material is my life's work as a dungeon master for Pen and Paper Dungeons and Dragons 3.5E and 5E and i will do my best to convert and adapt them to the balance and functionality of Baldur's Gate 3.
